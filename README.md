# LiberateGames
## Agentic UI Generator for Unity (Beta)
Turn natural language into working Unity UI screens. Describe the UI, get complete code ready to run in-editor.

**Supported UI Systems:**
- **UI Toolkit** (Stable): UXML layout + USS styles + C# bindings
- **uGUI** (Experimental - Not Stable): Canvas + GameObject hierarchy + C# scripts

- Input: a short prompt (e.g., "Settings menu with Audio, Graphics, Controls; Save/Cancel buttons")
- Output: Complete UI implementation with scripts


## Install
1. Download
 - Get the LiberateGames.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/LiberateGames/liberate-unity/releases).

2. Import

4. Start UI generation
 - Describe your UI in natural language and generate!

> Note: You may see a security popup asking for internet access. This is expected - LiberateGames uses a Python backend to leverage battle-tested AI libraries and frameworks. Please allow access for the local backend executable to function properly.
